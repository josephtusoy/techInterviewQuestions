SSIS

How does SSIS differ from DTS?
-SSIS segregates of the control/work flow from the data flow in Data Transformation Services
-add ability to use a buffer/memory oriented architecture 
 
Data flow versus Control Flow?
-CF -> operational work flow like condition and iteration. either failed or suceed
-DF -> to do with file, data. actual data manipulation
 
Complete Versus Success
- Success is completion without issues
- have to do with Precedence Constraints, order and condition of control flow tasks


package flow versus 


Types of transformations?
 Non-Blocking Synchronous Streaming Transformations (Fastest)
 Non-Blocking Synchronous Row-Based Transformations (Fast)

what is task?
-method, carries out individual unit of work

2 types of tasks in ssis
-Control Flow tasks and Database Maintenance tasks




CLR SQL

Example of Control flow task?


what is precedence constraints?
Precedence Constraints allow you to define the logical sequence of tasks in the order they should be executed. 
-Success 
-Failure 
-Complete

What is a container and how many types of containers are there?
-A container is a logical grouping of tasks which allows you to manage the scope of the tasks together.
These are the types of containers in SSIS:
1. Sequence Container - related tasks together
2. For Loop Container - repeating flow in package
3. For Each Loop Container - Enumerating each object in a collection


variable vs variable scope
- store values
scope -> coverage. ex. data flow, package


Complete versus Success?
