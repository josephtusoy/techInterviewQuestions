What do you mean by scaffolding?
- is a code generation framework for ASP.NET Web applications. Visual Studio 2013 includes pre-installed code generators for MVC and Web API projects. 
- You add scaffolding to your project when you want to quickly add code that interacts with data models.

Explain the page life cycle of MVC 
→App initialization
→Routing
→Instantiate and execute controller
→Locate and invoke controller action
→Instantiate and render view.

ASP Life Cycle?
-initialization
-load view state
-pre render
-save view state
-render 
-unload



What are the advantages of MVC over ASP.NET?
- Simultaneous development – Multiple developers can work simultaneously on the model, controller and views.
- High cohesion – MVC enables logical grouping of related actions on a controller together. The views for a specific model are also grouped together.
- Low coupling – The very nature of the MVC framework is such that there is low coupling among models, views or controllers
- Ease of modification – Because of the separation of responsibilities, future development or modification is easier
- Multiple views for a model – Models can have multiple views

-Integration of modern, client-side frameworks and development workflows.
-A cloud-ready, environment-based configuration system.
-Built-in dependency injection.
-A lightweight, high-performance, and modular HTTP request pipeline.
-Ability to host on IIS, Nginx, Apache, Docker, or self-host in your own process.
-Side-by-side app versioning when targeting .NET Core.
-Tooling that simplifies modern web development.
-Ability to build and run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
-Open-source and community-focused.




How is CLR and CLS connected?
CLS is a standard, specifically a document that says how programs created by

How is MSIL code 


What does MSIL code look like?
g-1000-IL

-is an object-oriented assembly language, and is entirely stack-based. bytecode,
 works in virtual machine, .net framework and not the specific hardware
- Assembly code is hardware targeted
