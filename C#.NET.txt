array vs list?
a -> same type, defined limit

instantiate vs initialize vs declare
instantiate -> means defining or creating new object for class to access all properties like methods, fields, etc. from class.
initialize -> assign initial value
declare -> both instantiate and initialize can happen during declaration or not


const vs readonly?
const-> static, cant be changed
readonly -> can only be changed in constructor, read only once assigned
